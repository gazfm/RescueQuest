# RescueGame

# Uncommitted files

The initial project (corresponding to the second commit to the repository) was generated using the command:
cocos2d-js-v3.3/tools/cocos2d-console/bin/cocos new RescueGame -l js

But the following folders (probably required for building on Android or ios) have not been committed due to their size:
/frameworks/js-bindings/
/frameworks/runtime-src/
/tools/

The html5 version of the game still works and the above folders can be re-generated using the above command (in a temp location) if needed.
